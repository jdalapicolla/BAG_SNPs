# Allele Frequency and Genetic Diversity in seed/germoplasm bank using SNPs and resampled datasets
Script for estimating influence of sample size in a germplasm/seeds bank (BAG) using allele frequency and genetic diversity of a wild species/population

In three steps:

1. Calculate Allele Frequency in a wild Species/Population

2. Calculate Allele Frequency in Resampled Datasets using a wild species/population as model.

3. Calculate Genetic Diversity in Resampled Datasets using a wild species/population as model.
