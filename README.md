# Estimating Allele Frequency and Genetic Diversity in seed/germoplasm bank using SNPs and resampled dataset
Script for estimating influence of sample size in a germoplasm/seeds bank (BAG) using allele frequency and genetic diversity of a extant species/population

In three steps:

1. Calculate Allelic Frequency in a extant Species/Population

2. Calculate Allelic Frequency in Resampled Datasets

3. Calculate Genetic Diversity in Resampled Datasets
